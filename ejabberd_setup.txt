==Install eJabberd==

On Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install ejabberd

On Mac os X:

see
http://www.ejabberd.im/download

(see also gotchas secton below. You need eJabberd version post 2.0 and then it includes bosh. More on installation 
here: http://notube.tv/2010/08/06/strophe-and-greasemonkey/)

==Configure==

edit
ejabberdctl.cfg
and
ejabberd.cfg 
for server name

be careful - these should be both the same

==Install module ejabberdctl expansion - optional - I find it useful==

mkdir ejabberd
cd ejabberd
svn co https://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd-modules
cd ejabberd-modules/mod_admin_extra/trunk
./build.sh
cd ebin
sudo cp mod_admin_extra.beam  /usr/lib/ejabberd/ebin/

==Configure bosh with apache==

for bosh, you'll need this:

.htaccess under top level (e.g /var/www/ on ubuntu)

RewriteEngine On

RewriteRule http-bind http://localhost:5280/http-bind/ [P]
RewriteRule http-bind/ http://localhost:5280/http-bind/ [P]
RewriteRule http-poll http://localhost:5280/http-poll/ [P]
RewriteRule http-poll/ http://localhost:5280/http-poll/ [P]
RewriteRule admin/ http://localhost:5280/admin/ [P]


You also may need to edit sites-enabled to allow .htaccess files - you need AllowOverride All.

==Start eJabberd==

ejabberd start -detached

==Various eJabberd Gotchas==

I recently had to install ejabberd elsewhere and forgot how incredibly fiddly it is to get working. So here’s a few 
gotchas and possible solutions:

* Problem: ejabberd won’t start

Try starting it as root user (not just sudo):

su root
ejabberd start

* Problem: ejabberd won't start in background

ejabberd start -detached

* Problem: running ejabberdctl gives an error like "Failed RPC connection to the node ‘ejabberd@localhost’: nodedown

su root
ejabberdctl

* Problem: bosh not working, even though the page /http-bind says it is

Edit modules part of config make sure you have right config! there are two! – check

ps ax | grep ejabberd

and that will show the correct one. The modules section should contain:

{mod_http_bind, []},
{mod_http_poll, []},

* Problem: Mysteriously still not working, on Amazon EC2

Make sure the right ports are open: 5222, 5223, 5280 – on EC2 you have to open these using for example the 
configuration dashboard. It's under 'security groups'

* Problem: Mysteriously still not working

HTML client *must* be on the same domain as http-bind
